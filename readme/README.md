# Netflix Clone with Movie Recommendation System

1. ðŸŽ¬ Developed user-based movie recommendation system by implementing user-user collaborative filtering.

2. ðŸŽ¬Used Netflix movie dataset containing 100,000 user records for developing recommendation engine.


# Algorithm:

What is Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative Filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by
collecting preferences or taste information from similar users.

1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient

â€¢ We achieved movie recommendation results by calculating the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and thereby
similarity between users based on the movies they watched and gave similar ratings.
â€¢ The coefficient value range from -1 to 1. Where -1 and 1 indicate a negative and positive correlation
respectively.
â€¢ Coefficient with value O indicates no correlation between the two variables.
â€¢ Statistically it can be said that Pearson Correlation Coefficient between two variables can be calculated as the
covariance of the variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.

## Setup instructions (how to launch the app)
- first open terminal
- cd backend
- pip3 install flask_cors
- pip3 install requests
- run python3 app.py (install dependencies in case of error)
- the flask server must be running on localhost port 8000
- then open a new terminal tab into the root directory and install node modules
    using npm i
- execute npm run start to launch the app on localhost:3000.

## Tech Stacks Used
- React , redux , python , flask , javascript , firebase 
- 2 API are used
- TMDB API and
- 
## Made my own Flask API - I made an API to get the recommendations from the model by providing the user ID and then fetched it in react app to display it.
